EXTRACTS – EGYPTIAN CIVIL CODE (Law No. 131 of 1948, as amended)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

Article 147 Force of Contract  
1. A contract makes the law of the parties. It may be revoked or altered only by
 mutual consent or for reasons prescribed by law.  
2. The contract must be performed in accordance with its contents and in a manner
 consistent with the principles of good faith.

Article 165 Liability for Non-Performance  
If performance of the obligation becomes impossible by reason of the debtor’s
fault, the debtor is liable for compensation for the damage suffered by the
creditor.

Article 218 Force Majeure  
If the debtor proves that the non-performance was due to an external cause which
could not have been foreseen or prevented (*force majeure*), the debtor shall not
be liable for damages. Where performance becomes temporarily impossible, the
obligation is suspended; the period of suspension is added to the agreed time for
performance.

Article 219 Partial Impossibility  
Where the impossibility is partial or temporary, the court may, according to the
circumstances, decide to reduce the obligation or extend the time for performance.

Article 374 Prescription of Contractual Claims  
All actions arising out of a contract shall be barred by prescription after
fifteen (15) years, except as otherwise provided by special laws.

► **Practical Implications for Construction Contracts**  
• Under Articles 218-219, events such as exceptional flooding on site that could
 not have been foreseen constitute *force majeure*, allowing the Contractor to
 request an extension of time without liability for delay penalties.  
• Article 147 imposes a duty of good faith; withholding notice of delay from the
 Employer may be considered bad faith and jeopardise entitlement to an extension.
