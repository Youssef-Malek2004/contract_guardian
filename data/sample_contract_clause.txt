PROJECT AGREEMENT – SECTION 20 TIME FOR COMPLETION AND COMPENSATION EVENTS
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

20.1 Contractor’s Obligation to Notify Delay  
The Contractor shall, within fourteen (14) days after becoming aware of any event or
circumstance that may cause delay to the Works, give written notice to the Engineer
describing (i) the event, (ii) the anticipated impact on the Time for Completion, and
(iii) the mitigation measures proposed. Failure to provide such notice within the
said period shall forfeit the Contractor’s entitlement to any extension of time or
associated cost.

20.2 Claim for Extension of Time (EOT)  
If completion of the Works is or will be delayed by any of the following causes,
the Contractor shall be entitled, **subject to Sub-Clause 20.1**, to an extension of
the Time for Completion equal to the period of delay properly attributable to such
cause:  
(a) Variations instructed under Clause 13;  
(b) Suspension or disruption caused by the Employer or the Engineer;  
(c) Unforeseeable physical conditions as defined in Sub-Clause 4.12;  
(d) Force majeure as described in Clause 19;  
(e) Delay attributable to public authorities, including late issuance of permits
  under Egyptian Law 5/2015 on Industrial Licensing.

The Contractor shall submit a *fully detailed* claim within twenty-eight (28) days
of the initial notice, identifying the contractual basis, causal analysis, and
substantiating records.

20.3 Prolongation Cost  
Where the delay entitling the Contractor to an extension of time also results in
additional cost, the Contractor shall be entitled to such cost in accordance with
Sub-Clause 12.3, provided the claim is made concurrently with the EOT submission.

20.4 Mitigation  
The Contractor shall at all times use reasonable endeavours to minimise delay and
associated cost, including acceleration or resequencing of activities where
practicable.

20.5 Time-bar  
No extension of time or cost shall be granted if the Contractor fails to comply
with the time limits stated in Sub-Clauses 20.1 and 20.2, unless the Engineer
determines that the circumstances justified late submission.
